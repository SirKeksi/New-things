So, I made some expansions for the Banking System! At first it only saved the logs in .txt documents. Which is fine but I wanted to learn how to use more professional or more common ways to save files. So I began to learn about JSONs!

The code for the dlc is not that sorted. I just wanted the changes to be seen in an extra file rather than just changing a file completely. The only change in "Banking System" is that the path now leads to a .json file. But what are the 
additions to the banking system and what did I aim for?

First thing is the JsonFormatter class. This class should be at the Banking System but like I said the changes are in an extra file. So up until line 10 it's all changes to the first code. So the class is pretty basic. We just need to
connect the formatter to the handler and all the changes are done. It was pretty fun to learn all that, especially how logger, formatter and handler classes can look, because I'm aiming to being able to code them myself one day. So the 
first step is done!

Next thing: I wanted to extract the informations from the JSON file to do a bit of data analysing and stuff. Basically analyzing which person deposited and withdrawn how much money in a month. So the dictionaries Datap (Data plus) 
and Datam (Data minus) are to collect it. While coding this sorting step I learned about the difference between JSON and JSONl and the top level element.

Once this was done you can use the data an plot it with matplotlib for example. I did not do it for now, because I already learned enough to call it a day. But of course I am gonna look into it, especially because I enjoy differential calculus
