# New-things
So, it has been rather quiet here. A few things happened that kinda slowed down my progress in Python. But I'm planning on doing more now besides learning C++ and Linux. I just dive into stuff I'm interested in and slowly but surely build a strong foundation

My goals are to first learn about different things that are possible in Python. I wanna understand how to be able to code web stuff / hardware stuff / and even more but also the theoretical background. All to be able to build good software in my future.

At the end here, I wanna combine as much as I can into a big project capable of many things! Let's see how this journey goes.
