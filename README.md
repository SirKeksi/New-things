# New-things
So, it has been rather quiet here. A few things happened that kinda slowed down my progress in Python. But I'm planning on doing more now besides learning C++ and Linux. I just dive into stuff I'm interested in and slowly but surely build a strong foundation

My goals are to first learn about different things that are possible in Python. I wanna understand the basics but also the theoratical background. All to be able to build good software in my future.
