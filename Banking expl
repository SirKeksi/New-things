So, I wanna talk about my code "Banking System" here a bit. I was interested in how to write logs in a pseudo professional way. So I began to learn the basics for paths, logging and handlers!

Here, the first step is to create a path to the log. Using Pathlib I am able to easily create a new .txt document if it doesn't exist already.

Next, the handler is being set up. Having already set a path to the log, I can directly use it and link it with the handler. The next is mere formatting.

The big one is the class Account. But it is quite simple. Every account gets a logger that transfers its messages to the handler. The log is written into the class so a process of setting up a new Account is as much automatic as it can be.
Then we have basic methods here, just what you wanna do on your account. Every finished method also emits a log entry, I mean where else to use the log?

The last thing is the method "check". It's more of a personal preference to have a function that outputs True or False elswhere instead of building the largest method to ever imagine. It is merely used to being able to setting up
two different scenarios. You can see those in the method "withdraw". It helps me to accordingly set up an output for the user and a new log entry.
